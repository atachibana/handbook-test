, particularly on phones. Phones don’t display tabs the way desktop browsers do. Phones hide tabs beneath a tab switcher button. Tapping the tab switcher brings up a stack of tabs. Opening in new windows in mobile can result in a lot of discarded tabs, making it hard to find the parent window of your current session. Each of these windows is a fork, a side quest split from the main quest. The original window goes on to the stack of discarded windows, and the new window becomes the questing venue until the next fork. Open in new window is particularly bad with post preview. Tapping preview in the post editor opens a preview of the post in a new window. That window takes over the screen and the parent session that launched the preview is now out of sight. Going back to the parent session requires tapping the tab switcher and finding the parent session in the stack of windows, not always easy when you have a bunch of forks lying around. Back in the parent editing session, if you tap preview again the button seems to do nothing. The preview window that was opened last time you clicked preview is being refreshed, but you can’t see it because that window is out of sight.

Forking flow by opening in new windows is often the result of unresolved [desktop bias](https://make.wordpress.org/test/glossary/#desktop-bias). Opening in new windows is a common desktop pattern that doesn’t work well on mobile.

Keyboard flyup

Auto-focusing search fields in modals is recommended practice on desktop, but on mobile it is an example of [desktop bias](https://make.wordpress.org/test/glossary/#desktop-bias). When search fields are auto-focused on touch devices, the keyboard flies up when the modal opens.

> Real life is complicated. It’s full of joy and excitement, sure, but also stress, anxiety, fear, shame, and crisis. We might experience harassment or abuse, lose a loved one, become chronically ill, get into an accident, have a financial emergency, or simply be vulnerable for not fitting into society’s expectations.
> 
> None of these circumstances is ideal, but all of them are part of life—and, odds are, your site or product has plenty of users in these moments, whether you’ve ever thought about them or not.
> 
> Our industry tends to call these edge cases—things that affect an insignificant number of users. But the term itself is telling, as information designer and programmer Evan Hensleigh puts it: “Edge cases define the boundaries of who \[and\] what you care about” ([http://bkaprt.com/dfrl/00-01/](https://href.li/?http://bkaprt.com/dfrl/00-01/)). They demarcate the border between the people you’re willing to help and the ones you’re comfortable marginalizing.
> 
> That’s why we’ve chosen to look at these not as edge cases, but as stress cases: the moments that put our design and content choices to the test of real life.
> 
> It’s a test we haven’t passed yet. When faced with users in distress or crisis, too many of the experiences we build fall apart in ways large and small.
> 
> Instead of treating stress situations as fringe concerns, it’s time we move them to the center of our conversations—to start with our most vulnerable, distracted, and stressed-out users, and then work our way outward. The reasoning is simple: when we  
> make things for people at their worst, they’ll work that much better when people are at their best.

Many people like to print recipes, including myself (@ryan). Printing recipes may seem old school to some, but I started doing it again after years of using tablets and food apps. Paper works in the kitchen. My family pins recipe print outs on a board in the kitchen and revise and annotate as we iterate on a dish or adapt it to a new piece of equipment. Occasionally, I snap photos of the paper, add them to a folder on my universal camera roll service, and call that backup. Empathize with old school, and always empathize with the love of print.

When experiencing a theme that doesn’t provide print-styles.css, remember this anecdote. CoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. bundled themes should always empathize with print.
