# FAQ for FSE Outreach Experiment

*This is a FAQ for the* [*Full Site Editing Outreach Experiment*](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/full-site-editing-outreach-experiment/)*. If you have a question to add to this document, please share it in [#fse-outreach-experiment](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-outreach-experiment/) in* [*WordPress slack*](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/)*.*

**What is the goal of this experimental outreach program?**

The goal is to improve the Full Site Editing experience by gathering feedback from WordPress site builders. 

**What led to this program being created?**

For big picture context, Full Site Editing is a [major part of Phase 2 of Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/). Inspired by the constructive feedback following the 5.0 release, this experiment is an effort to elicit early and frequent feedback from users in advance of future major releases.

**Why is it an experiment?**

Because something like this has never been tried before for gathering feedback, and Full Site Editing itself is still in progress. This builds flexibility into the approach and lets the program evolve as it needs to alongside the software. 

**How long will this experiment run for?**

The ending point of this program isn’t decided yet, but it definitely will end. Nothing lasts forever! It’s important to note though that the program will err on the side of sticking around for too long rather than ending it early. 

**Is this the only way to give feedback about Full Site Editing?**

No—This is WordPress after all. You’re welcome and encouraged to [share your feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/) as this program is meant to supplement not replace the current feedback pathways.  

**What kind of feedback is this program looking for?**

This program aims to get feedback on everything from workflow changes (ie something that used to take three clicks now takes six) to general bug reports to “wish list” items people want to see. 

**What kind of users should join this program?**

If you build with WordPress for others (compared to those who build WordPress) and/or maintain WordPress sites (compared to those who visit sites) and/or who create content, this program is a great fit. If you’re not sure, join anyway and see for yourself. 

**How can I join this program?**

Simply create a [WordPress slack account](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and join the channel [#fse-outreach-experiment](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-outreach-experiment/). 

**Are there any other ways I can help with this program?**

Outside of testing, a big way to help is to share the calls for testing with your networks! Otherwise, there are three additional “roles” that the program could use help with:

*   Help with writing the calls for testing and the summary posts.
*   Help with wrangling responses to the feedback received whether that means responding to comments, creating GitHub issues, etc.
*   Help with amplification by sharing the calls for testing and summary posts in appropriate channels.

If you’re interested in any of these roles, please ping @annezazu in WordPress.org slack! All help is appreciated.

**What are the expectations of being a part of this program?** 

You can expect this program to take up to 3 hours a week on average but ideally won’t require that much time. Don’t fret if that seems like more time than you can commit. The plan is to make involvement flexible enough for people with different levels of capacity to still be able to join the fun. 

**What do I need to join this program?**

All you need is time and a testing environment, which you can find more information [here](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/get-setup-for-testing/). If a testing environment is a blocker for you in any way, please contact @annezazu in WordPress slack**.** If time is a blocker, join the club and feel free to chat with @annezazu about how you  might still be able to help out. 

**Where are decisions about Full Site Editing being made?**

To get involved in decision making for Full Site Editing, jump into [the weekly Core Editor meetings](https://make.wordpress.org/core/). Those meetings along with joining the [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/) are the best place to dive deep into the world of Gutenberg. 

**Where will the results of this program be published?**

All posts will be shared on the [Make Test Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/test/) with cross posts to [Make Core Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core) using the following tags for ease of use:

All calls for testing and summaries will be shared on [Make Test](https://make.wordpress.org/test/) with a cross post to [Make Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/). Here are the tags you can use to follow along specifically:

*   Calls for testing: [#fse-testing-call](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-testing-call/) 
*   Summaries of feedback from calls for testing: [#fse-testing-summary](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-testing-summary/) 
*   All posts: [#fse-outreach-program](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-outreach-program/) 

If you’re in the [#fse-outreach-experiment](https://make.wordpress.org/test/tag/fse-outreach-experiment/) channel, the posts will also be shared there for ease of access.
